## Features

### User Interface

- Responsive and visually appealing design using custom CSS and Module CSS.
- Optimized layout for various screen sizes and devices.

### State Management

- Efficient and scalable state management with Redux Toolkit.
- Centralized state logic for seamless data flow across components.

### TypeScript Integration

- Ensures type safety and improved code maintainability.
- Reduces runtime errors and enhances development efficiency.

### API Integration

- Axios for handling HTTP requests and data fetching.
- Uses JSON Server (db.json) for mock backend and local data storage.

### Custom Styling

- Handcrafted styles for a polished and modern look.
- Uses Module CSS for better component encapsulation.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Module CSS
- JSON Server (db.json)

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd YourRepository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the JSON Server:**

   ```sh
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and the mock backend will be available at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
